Exceptions cannot be compared in a standard way (==),
this lead to a failure inside quickCheck

Local definitions - a way to store some intermediate result to avoid

Scope defines the program part where a particular definition can be used

If there are several visible variables with the same name defined,

Separate functions for conversion between strings and integers

show :: Show a => a -> String

and

read :: Read a => String -> a,
when converting a String to an integer, we need to specify to
what we want to convert --

read "5" => Error
read "5" :: Int => 5
read "5" :: Float => 5.0
read "5" :: Double => 5.0

(...) is called a tuple constructor
